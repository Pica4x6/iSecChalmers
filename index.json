Many cryptographic properties rely on the difficulty of generating an adversary who, given an object sampled from one of two classes, correctly distinguishes the class used to generate that object. In the case of cipher suite distinguishing problem, the classes are two different cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on machine learning to automatically generate classifiers that can be used by an adversary to solve any distinguishing problem. We discuss the assumptions, a basic approach for improving the advantage of the adversary as well as a phenomenon that we call the “blind spot paradox” . We apply our methodology to generate distinguishers for the NIST (DRBG) cipher suite problem. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the distinguishers might statistically have some advantage to distinguish between the DRBG used.

Traditionally, these guarantees are established under a sequential execution semantics. However, this semantics is not aligned with the behavior of modern processors that make use of speculative execution to improve performance. This mismatch, combined with the high-profile Spectre-style attacks that exploit speculative execution, naturally casts doubts on the robustness of high-assurance cryptography guarantees. In this paper, we dispel these doubts by showing that the benefits of high-assurance cryptography extend to speculative execution, costing only a modest performance overhead. We build atop the Jasmin verification framework an end-to-end approach for proving properties of cryptographic software under speculative execution, and validate our approach experimentally with efficient, functionally correct assembly implementations of ChaCha20 and Poly1305, which are secure against both traditional timing and speculative execution attacks.","tags":["csstalk","Cryptography","Program Verification"],"title":"High-Assurance Cryptography Software in the Spectre Era","type":"event"},{"authors":["Carlos Tomé"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622812500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622812500,"objectID":"b5bf52e05ca834d1413d0d3364d60221","permalink":"iSec/event/2021/2021-06-04-css-talk43/","publishdate":"2021-06-04T13:15:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2021/2021-06-04-css-talk43/","section":"event","summary":" There is a long line of research on how to control information flow in pure programming languages.  In Haskell, for instance, the MAC library [Russo 2015] provides IFC primitives that allows programmers to write (statically) secure programs. MAC enforces security by controlling the interaction of an indexed monad for print effects, MAC, and a type for labeling data, Labeled.\nIn this talk, I will present a different point in the design space of IFC libraries which in some sense refines MAC. The starting point will be a pure language where the monad for print effects\u0026mdash;think of IO in Haskell restricted to print\u0026mdash;keeps track of the output channels within the type. Looking at MAC in this setting, we see that one can safely embed effectful computations into the MAC monad.

To complement them, I propose a programming language-based framework that uses IFC mechanisms to enforce privacy principles such as purpose limitation and data minimization.

The variety of information that can be transmitted from inputs to outputs in a deterministic system can be elegantly and very generally captured by representing information as equivalence relations over the sets of possible values, using an equivalence relation on the input domain to model what may be learned, and an equivalence relation on the output to model what may be observed. The set of equivalence relations over a given set of values form a lattice, where the partial order models containment of information, and lattice join models the effect of combining information. This elegant and general structure is sometimes referred to as the lattice of information (Landauer \u0026 Redmond CSFW'93).\nIn this work we identify an abstraction of information flow which has not been studied previously, namely disjunctive dependency. We argue that this is both interesting in its own right, providing for example an information flow based semantic model of Chinese-wall policies, and potentially provides increased precision in the application of dependency analysis to computation of quantitative properties. We achieve this via a generalization of the lattice of information to a quantale, a lattice equipped with a tensor operation where the lattice join corresponds to the disjunctive combination of information, and tensor corresponds to conjunctive combination.","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"A Quantale of Information","type":"event"},{"authors":["David Jacoby"],"categories":null,"content":"David Jacoby is a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.

However, researchers have shown that even aggregated data such as histograms, containing no obvious sensitive attributes, can result in privacy leakage. To enable data analysis, a strong notion of privacy is required to avoid risking unintended privacy violations.\nSuch a strong notion of privacy is differential privacy, a statistical notion of privacy that makes privacy leakage quantifiable. The caveat regarding differential privacy is that while it has strong guarantees for privacy, privacy comes at a cost of accuracy. Despite this trade-off being a central and important issue in the adoption of differential privacy, there exists a gap in the literature regarding providing an understanding of the trade-off and how to address it appropriately.\nThrough a systematic literature review (SLR), we investigate the state-of-the-art within accuracy improving differentially private algorithms for histogram and synthetic data publishing. Our contribution is two-fold: 1) we identify trends and connections in the contributions to the field of differential privacy for histograms and synthetic data and 2) we provide an understanding of the privacy/accuracy trade-off challenge by crystallizing different dimensions to accuracy improvement. Accordingly, we position and visualize the ideas in relation to each other and external work, and deconstruct each algorithm to examine the building blocks separately with the aim of pinpointing which dimension of accuracy improvement each technique/approach is targeting. Hence, this systematization of knowledge (SoK) provides an understanding of in which dimensions and how accuracy improvement can be pursued without sacrificing privacy.

A promising approach to enforcing these policies is to use Information Flow Control (IFC) frameworks, which separate policy specification from the application code and automatically enforce policies either dynamically (at run time) or statically (at compile time). While static enforcement is desirable because it catches errors early and avoids run-time overhead, existing static IFC frameworks either lack support for expressive data-dependent policies (necessary in modern applications), or require manual proofs or annotations to be strewed throughout the application code.\nIn this talk I will present Lifty, a static IFC framework that overcomes the limitations of existing static approaches. A Lifty programmer annotates the sources of sensitive data with expressive, data-dependent security policies, and Lifty statically and automatically verifies that the application handles the data according to the policies. Moreover, if verification fails, Lifty suggests a provably correct repair, thereby easing the programmer burden of implementing policy enforcing code throughout the application. The main insight behind Lifty is to encode information flow control using liquid types, an expressive yet decidable type system. Liquid types enable fully automatic checking of complex policies, and power our repair mechanism via type-driven error localization and patch synthesis.

The acceptance of extensions in current browsers is unquestionable. For instance, Chrome's official extension repository has more than 63,000 extensions, with some of them having more than 10M users. When installed, extensions are pushed into an internal queue within the browser. The order in which each extension executes depends on a number of factors, including their relative installation times. In this paper, we demonstrate how this order can be exploited by an unprivileged malicious extension (i.e., one with no more permissions than those already assigned when accessing web content) to get access to any private information that other extensions have previously introduced. We propose a solution that does not require modifying the core browser engine, since it is implemented as another browser extension. We prove that our approach effectively protects the user against usual attackers (i.e., any other installed extension) as well as against strong attackers having access to the effects of all installed extensions (i.e., knowing who did what).

Our criterion is the first to model dynamic compromise in a system of mutually distrustful components with clearly specified privileges. It articulates how each component should be protected from all the others\u0026mdash;in particular, from components that have encountered undefined behavior and become compromised. To illustrate the model, we construct a secure compilation chain for a small unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components, targeting a simple abstract machine with built-in compartmentalization. We propose a novel proof technique and give a machine-checked proof in Coq that this compiler satisfies our secure compilation criterion.

Our aim is to describe and implement the simplest possible solution to provide data integrity in cloud-based scenarios. Concretely, our multi-key linearly homomorphic signature scheme (mklhs) allows users to upload signed data on a server, and at any later point in time any third party can query the server to compute a linear combination of data authenticated by different users and check the correctness of the returned result. Our construction generalizes Boneh et al.’s linearly homomorphic signature scheme (PKC’09 [7]) to the multi-key setting and relies on basic tools of pairing-based cryptography. Compared to existing multi-key homomorphic signature schemes, our mklhs is a conceptually simple and elegant direct construction, which trades-off privacy for efficiency. The simplicity of our approach leads us to a very efficient construction that enjoys significantly shorter signatures and higher performance than previous proposals. Finally, we implement mklhs using two different pairing-friendly curves at the 128-bit security level, a Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve and a Barreto-Naehrig curve. Our benchmarks illustrate interesting performance trade-offs between these parameters, involving the cost of exponentiation and hashing inpairing groups. We provide a discussion on such trade-offs that can be useful to other implementers of pairing-based protocols.\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1571270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571270400,"objectID":"cf7985fbd9c59249c1647de7f0220188","permalink":"iSec/event/2019/2019-10-17-css-talk25/","publishdate":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2019/2019-10-17-css-talk25/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Elena Pagnin from Aarhus University, Denmark \\\nWhen: 10:00 - 11:00 Thursday {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: Room 8103, EDIT building.\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nWe consider the problem of outsourcing computation on data authenticated by different users.","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"The Simplest Multi-key Linearly Homomorphic Signature Scheme","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":"talk","content":"Who: Daniele Friolo from Sapienza University of Rome, Italy \\\nWhen: 15:00 - 16:00 Wednesday {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: Room 5128, EDIT building.\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nWe investigate the security of smart contracts within a blockchain that can fork (as Bitcoin and Ethereum). In particular, we focus on multi-party computation (MPC) protocols run on-chain with the aid of smart contracts, and observe that honest players face the following dilemma: Should I rush sending protocol\u0026rsquo;s messages based on the current view of the blockchain, or rather wait that a message is confirmed on the chain before sending the next one?\nTo the best of our knowledge, the (implicit) default option used in previous work is the second one and thus known on-chain MPC protocols take long time to be executed on those blockchains with a long confirmation time (e.g., 1 hour per transaction in Bitcoin). While the first option would clearly be preferable for efficiency, we show that this is not necessarily the case for security, as there are natural examples of on-chain MPC protocols that simply become insecure in presence of rushing players.\nOur contributions are twofold:\n For the concrete case of fairly tossing multiple coins with penalties, we show that the lottery protocol of Andrychowicz et al. (S\u0026amp;P \u0026lsquo;14) becomes insecure in the presence of rushing players. In addition, we present a new protocol that instead retains security even if the players are rushing. We design a compiler that takes any on-chain MPC protocol and transforms it into another one (for the same task) that remains secure even in the presence of rushing players. The only (unavoidable) requirement is that honest players start to be rushing after the first round of the protocol (by all players) has been confirmed on the blockchain.  Our techniques are inspired by ideas on resettably secure computation (Goyal and Sahai, EUROCRYPT \u0026lsquo;09). We also provide a prototype implementation of our coin tossing protocol using Ethereum smart contracts, and instantiate our generic compiler in a concrete setting, showing that both our constructions yield considerable improvements in terms of efficiency.\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1571184e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571184e3,"objectID":"14b2d3566c50ad548e8dee552a1765a7","permalink":"iSec/event/2019/2019-10-16-css-talk24/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2019/2019-10-16-css-talk24/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Daniele Friolo from Sapienza University of Rome, Italy \\\nWhen: 15:00 - 16:00 Wednesday {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: Room 5128, EDIT building.\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"The Rush Dilemma: Attacking and Repairing Smart Contracts on Forking Blockchains","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":"talk","content":"Who: Elena Pagnin from Aarhus University, Denmark \\\nWhen: 10:00 - 11:00 Wednesday {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: Room Analysen, EDIT building.\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nAs messaging applications are becoming increasingly popular, it is of utmost importance to analyze their security and mitigate existing weaknesses. This paper focuses on one of the most acclaimed messaging applications: Signal.\nSignal is a protocol that provides end-to-end channel security, forward secrecy, and post-compromise security. These features are achieved thanks to a key-ratcheting mechanism that updates the key material at every message. Due to its high security impact, Signal’s key-ratcheting has recently been formalized, along with an analysis of its security.\nIn this paper, we revisit Signal, describing some attacks against the original design and proposing SAID: Signal Authenticated and IDentity-based. As the name indicates, our protocol relies on an identity-based setup, which allows us to dispense with Signal’s centralized server. We use the identity-based long-term secrets to obtain persistent and explicit authentication, such that SAID achieves higher security guarantees than Signal.\nWe prove the security of SAID not only in the Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) model (as done by previous work), but also in the Authenticated and Confidential Channel Establishment (ACCE) model, which we adapted and redefined for SAID and asynchronous messaging protocols in general into a model we call identity-based Multistage Asynchronous Messaging (iMAM). We believe our model to be more faithful in particular to the true security of Signal, whose use of the message keys prevents them from achieving the composable guarantee claimed by previous analysis.\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1556064e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556064e3,"objectID":"dfe744691d291e2e75a3a15aaf8c6a20","permalink":"iSec/event/2019/2019-04-24-css-talk23/","publishdate":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2019/2019-04-24-css-talk23/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Elena Pagnin from Aarhus University, Denmark \\\nWhen: 10:00 - 11:00 Wednesday {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: Room Analysen, EDIT building.\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nAs messaging applications are becoming increasingly popular, it is of utmost importance to analyze their security and mitigate existing weaknesses.","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"SAID: Reshaping Signal into an Identity-Based Asynchronous Messaging Protocol with Authenticated Ratcheting","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Juan Tapiador","Gerardo Schneider"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637038407,"objectID":"70ae3371faca10f844216734bf51e209","permalink":"iSec/publication/ortiz-martin-2019/","publishdate":"2021-11-16T04:53:25.178245Z","relpermalink":"iSec/publication/ortiz-martin-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we address the problem of how two devices that are sensing the same heart signal can generate the same cryptographic token by extracting them from the Inter-Pulse Intervals (IPIs) of each cardiac signal.

We first show that it is impossible, in general, to correct the differences between the IPIs derived from two captured electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when using only error correction techniques, thus being impossible to corroborate previous claims on the feasibility of this approach. Then, we provide a large-scale evaluation of the proposed method (run-time monitor and fuzzy extractor) over 19 public databases from the Physionet repository containing heart signals. The results clearly show the practicality of our proposal achieving a 91% of synchronization probability for healthy individuals. Additionally, we also conduct an experiment to check how long the sensors should record the heart signal in order to generate tokens of 32, 64 and 128 bits. Contrarily to what it is usually assumed (6, 12, and 24 s for individuals with a heart rate of 80 beats-per-minute), the sensors have to wait 13, 28 and 56.5 s on median, respectively, to derive the same token from both sensors.","tags":["\"Biometrics\"","\"Body sensor networks\"","\"Privacy\"","\"Security\""],"title":"Feasibility analysis of Inter-Pulse Intervals based solutions for cryptographic token generation by two electrocardiogram sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Sjosten","Steven Van Acker","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Andrei Sabelfeld"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637038408,"objectID":"d593d381874bef54a6888eeb979eb229","permalink":"iSec/publication/sjosten-2019/","publishdate":"2021-11-16T04:53:28.536489Z","relpermalink":"iSec/publication/sjosten-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Browser extensions enable rich experience for the users of today's web. Being deployed with elevated privileges, extensions are given the power to overrule web pages. As a result, web pages often seek to detect the installed extensions, sometimes for benign adoption of their behavior but sometimes as part of privacy-violating user fingerprinting. Researchers have studied a class of attacks that allow detecting extensions by probing for Web Accessible Resources (WARs) via URLs that include public extension IDs. Realizing privacy risks associated with WARs, Firefox has recently moved to randomize a browser extension's ID, prompting the Chrome team to plan for following the same path. However, rather than mitigating the issue, the randomized IDs can in fact exacerbate the extension detection problem, enabling attackers to use a randomized ID as a reliable fingerprint of a user. We study a class of extension revelation attacks, where extensions reveal themselves by injecting their code on web pages. We demonstrate how a combination of revelation and probing can uniquely identify 90% out of all extensions injecting content, in spite of a randomization scheme. We perform a series of large-scale studies to estimate possible implications of both classes of attacks.

One area that has received much attention lately is the use of (human) biological signals as the basis for biometric authentication, identification and the generation of cryptographic keys. The heart signal (e.g., as recorded in an electrocardiogram) has been used by several researchers in the last few years. Specifically, the so-called Inter-Pulse Intervals (IPIs), which is the time between two consecutive heartbeats, have been repeatedly pointed out as a potentially good source of entropy and are at the core of various recent authentication protocols. In this work, we report the results of a large-scale statistical study to determine whether such an assumption is (or not) upheld. For this, we have analyzed 19 public datasets of heart signals from the Physionet repository, spanning electrocardiograms from 1353 subjects sampled at different frequencies and with lengths that vary between a few minutes and several hours. We believe this is the largest dataset on this topic analyzed in the literature. We have then applied a standard battery of randomness tests to the extracted IPIs. Under the algorithms described in this paper and after analyzing these 19 public ECG datasets, our results raise doubts about the use of IPI values as a good source of randomness for cryptographic purposes. This has repercussions both in the security of some of the protocols proposed up to now and also in the design of future IPI-based schemes.","tags":["\"Authentication\"","\"Biometric\"","\"Implantable medical devices\"","\"Inter-pulse intervals\"","\"Privacy\"","\"Randomness\""],"title":"Heartbeats do not make good pseudo-random number generators: An analysis of the randomness of inter-pulse intervals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Pagnin","Carlo Brunetta","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637038407,"objectID":"0379bcd87d2be424c55747b7e56af2b0","permalink":"iSec/publication/pagnin-2018/","publishdate":"2021-11-16T04:53:27.814092Z","relpermalink":"iSec/publication/pagnin-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of privacy-preserving processing of outsourced data in the context of user-customised services.

Given that the Archive stores all client-side code as well as relevant header information, this enabled us to analyze trends over the last years, which allow us to draw conclusions on how future security mechanisms should be implemented.\nOn the other hand, while as a community we have become very good at discovering vulnerabilities at scale (regardless of Web or network level flaws), informing the affected parties about the issues has only been treated as a side note in previous research. To understand how such notifications can be conducted at scale, we conducted an experiment in which we notified more than 44,000 vulnerable domains, using different communication channels. Our work shows that reaching administrators is the biggest roadblock to a successful notification.

The compiler uses a sequence of intermediate languages to gradually and successively transform a specification of a probabilistic model into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm for execution on the CPU or GPU.\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1488758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488758400,"objectID":"f46f71d7f6ee740286f026f3ca1c94d9","permalink":"iSec/event/2017/2017-03-06-css-talk19/","publishdate":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2017/2017-03-06-css-talk19/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Daniel Huang \\\nWhen: 16.00 {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: 5128 (Grouproom) \\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nIn this talk, we will present some of our recent work on probabilistic programming languages.","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"Recent work on probabilistic programming languages","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":"talk","content":"Who: Riccardo Scandariato \\\nWhen: 11h00 - 11h30 {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\\\nWhere: Lindholmen, Jupiter building, 4th floor, room 473\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nThreat analysis is the cornerstone of security-by-design and privacy-by-design approaches for building more secure and privacy-friendly software systems.

This reuse leads to questions concerning security, and whether one can trust that third-party code will not leak users’ sensitive information. As it stands today, these concerns are well-founded.\nWith the web’s current security primitives there is a trade-off between developer flexibility and user privacy. If developers choose to include untrusted code then users’ privacy suffers. On the other hand, if developers abstain from reusing third-party code, user privacy is favoured, on the cost of developer flexibility. This trade-off can partly be attributed to the fact that the security primitives are discretionary, where untrusted code either is granted or denied access to data. After code has been granted access to data there is no further attempt to verify that the data is used properly.\nIn 2014, Stefan et al. proposed a security mechanism which called COWL (Confinement of Origin Web Labels). COWL is a mandatory access control which is able to let untrusted code compute on sensitive information, while confining it. Through this, COWL is able to address some of the shortcomings of the web’s current security mechanisms, and in the end effectively eliminate the trade-off that exists. Since the introduction of COWL, it has gone on to become a W3C standard.\nThis thesis evaluates the COWL W3C specification by deploying it in Mozilla Firefox. While COWL aims to mainly address information leaks caused by bugs, we bring the specification towards addressing malicious code by highlighting two covert channels: one due to the browser layout engine, and another due to browser optimizations. Furthermore, we implement two case studies which shows how COWL can be used, and as part of this, note some practical problems.Through the thesis we managed to make contributions to the COWL W3C specification.\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1465344e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465344e3,"objectID":"65509ea358a7fd8442dc920968eb9d23","permalink":"iSec/event/2016/2016-06-08-css-talk16/","publishdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2016/2016-06-08-css-talk16/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Niklas Andreasson\\\nWhen: 10:00, June 8 \\\nWhere: room EDIT 8103\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nWeb applications are often composed by resources such as JavaScript written, and provided, by different parties.","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"Enhancing the COWL W3C Standard","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":"talk","content":"Who: Peter Y A Ryan (University of Luxembourg)\\\nWhen: 14:30, June 8 \\\nWhere: room EDIT 81033\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nIn conventional cryptographic E2E verification schemes, voters are provided with encrypted ballots that enable them to confirm that their vote is accurately included in the tally. Technically this is very appealing, but voters, election officials etc. need to understand some rather subtle arguments to appreciate the integrity and ballot secrecy guarantees provided by such mechanisms.\nA simple way to achieve a degree of verifiability and ballot privacy is to provide each voter with a unique, private tracking number. Votes are posted on a bulletin board in the clear along with their tracking number. Thus voters can visit the WBB confirm that there is an entry with their tracking number showing the correct vote. The beauty of this approach is its simplicity and understandability. There are, however, two drawbacks: we must ensure that trackers are unique and a coercer can demand that the voter reveal her tracking number. It is interesting to note that the coercer must ask for the tracker before posting. If he asks after posting the voter has a simple strategy to fool him: just reads off a tracker number with the coercer\u0026rsquo;s required vote from the WBB.\nIn this talk, I describe a scheme that addresses both of these problems. The main idea is to close off the coercer\u0026rsquo;s window of opportunity by ensuring that the voters only learn their tracker numbers after votes have been posted. Notification of the trackers must provide high assurance but be deniable. The resulting scheme provides receipt-freeness but also provides a more immediately understandable form of verifiability: voters can find their vote, in the clear, in the tally identified by their secret tracker.\nHowever, there is a sting in the tail: a coerced voter might light on the coercer\u0026rsquo;s tracker, or the coercer may simply claim that the tracker is his. I describe some elaborations of the basic scheme to counter this problem.\nhttp://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1105.pdf\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1465344e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465344e3,"objectID":"d8db38d435bdf57ed84e54f632c8a3b2","permalink":"iSec/event/2016/2016-06-08-css-talk15/","publishdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2016/2016-06-08-css-talk15/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Peter Y A Ryan (University of Luxembourg)\\\nWhen: 14:30, June 8 \\\nWhere: room EDIT 81033\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nIn conventional cryptographic E2E verification schemes, voters are provided with encrypted ballots that enable them to confirm that their vote is accurately included in the tally.","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"Selene: Voting with Transparent Verification and Coercion Mitigation","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":"talk","content":"Who: Gilles Barthe (IMDEA)\\\nWhen: 13:30, May 31 \\\nWhere: room EDIT 8103\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nDifferential privacy is a statistical notion of privacy which achieves compelling trade-offs between input privacy and accuracy (of outputs).

The final section of the talk will deal with the definition and application of indistinguishable Obfuscation. More precisely, I will recall the syntax of FHE schemes and provide a trivial (extremely inefficient) construction of a FHE scheme. I will then cite the most significant papers in the area, highlight the trend and evolution of FHE schemes over the years (since Gentry’s first construction in 2009) and finally conclude with a slide that shows the timing required to perform homomorphic operations on a FHE scheme implemented by Halevi. The main focus of the talk is on Muliti-Linear Maps (MLM). Roughly speaking, MLMs can be thought of as a FHE scheme in which there is no decryption, but it is possible to check if two (top level) cipher-texts are equal or not. This latter property is called zero testing and it is the main feature, but also weakness, of MLMs. I will present the second MLM candidate, the CLT13, which is based on relatively easy mathematical tools (congruences and Chinese Remainder Theorem), and its cryptanalysis (zeroing attack). The talk will end with an introduction to obfuscation. \u0026gt;From an abstract point of view, one could think at obfuscation as a MLM without zero testing and in which only a pre-determined sequence of operations is allowed. In practice, an obfuscator is an algorithm that takes as input a program P and outputs another program O(P). such that O(P) and P have equal outputs on equal inputs and O(P) is an intelligible program.\nPrevious Talks {: .t60 } {% include list-posts tag=\u0026lsquo;csstalk\u0026rsquo;%}\n","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459468800,"objectID":"5b3531dfa215ffc52d72136aead2e3f9","permalink":"iSec/event/2016/2016-04-1-css-talk7/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"iSec/event/2016/2016-04-1-css-talk7/","section":"event","summary":"Who: Elena Pagnin When: Friday April 1, 11:00 Where: Room 8103 Title: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract: This talk is supposed to give an overview of the state of the art in the area of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Multi-Linear Maps (MLM).","tags":["csstalk"],"title":"Recent Breakthroughs in Obfuscation","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":"talk","content":"Who: Matteo Maffei\\\nWhen: Thursday, {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}, 13:30-14:30\\\nWhere: Room 3364\\\nTitle: {{ page.title }}\nAbstract:\\\nIn this talk, I will present two ongoing projects on the formal verification of security properties for mobile and web applications.\nIn the first part, I will present HornDroid, a novel technique for the static analysis of information flow properties in Android applications. The core idea underlying HornDroid is to use Horn clauses for soundly abstracting the semantics of Android applications and to express security properties as a set of proof obligations that are automatically discharged by SMT solving. This approach makes it possible to fine-tune the analysis in order to achieve a high degree of precision while still relying on off-the-shelf verification tools, thereby automatically leveraging the recent advances in this field. As a matter of fact, HornDroid outperforms in precision state-of-the-art Android static analysis tools on benchmarks proposed by the community, besides being orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, HornDroid is the first static analysis tool for Android to come with a formal proof of soundness: besides yielding correctness assurances, this proof allowed us to identify some critical corner-cases that affect the soundness guarantees provided by some of the previous static analysis tools for Android.\nIn the second part, I will present Michrome, a security enforcement tool for web applications based on micro-policies. Micro-policies, originally proposed to implement hardware-level security monitors, constitute a flexible and general enforcement technique, based on assigning security tags to system components and taking security actions based on dynamic checks over these tags. In this work, we present the first application of micro-policies to web security, by proposing a core browser model supporting them and studying its effectiveness at securing web sessions. In our view, web session security requirements are expressed in terms of a simple, purely declarative information flow policy, which is then automatically translated into a micro-policy implementing it. This leads to a browser-side enforcement mechanism which is elegant, sound and flexible, while being accessible to web developers. We show how a large class of attacks against web sessions can be uniformly and effectively prevented by the adoption of this approach. Since we carefully designed micro-policies with ease of deployment in mind, we are also able to implement our proposal as a Google Chrome extension, Michrome: our experiments show that Michrome can be easily configured to enforce strong security policies without breaking the websites functionality.\nBiographical Note\nMatteo Maffei is professor at Saarland University and CISPA, where he leads the Secure and Privacy-preserving Systems group.

For example, a formally verified micro-kernel, micro-hypervisor, or a subsystem obtained from a trustworthy provider must be booted on a computer system that runs Windows, Linux, or Android applications. Establishing root of trust assures the user that either the system is in a malware-free state in which the trustworthy-program boot takes place or the presence of malware is discovered, with high probability. Obtaining such assurance is challenging because malware can survive in system state across repeated secure- and trusted-boot operations. These operations do not always have malware-unmediated access to device memories; e.g., memories of bring-your-own devices (e.g., keyboards, consoles, printers, routers), and sometimes even disk controllers. They certainly have no unmediated access to all non-volatile memories of interconnected components of a personal system; e.g., components of home systems, autos. To date, concrete assurance for root-of-trust establishment has not been obtained on commodity systems that scale to large configurations. \\\nEstablishing root of trust makes all persistent malware ephemeral and forces the adversary to repeat the malware-insertion attack, perhaps at some added cost. Nevertheless, some malware-controlled software can always be assumed to exist in commodity operating systems and applications. The inherent size and complexity of their operating systems and applications (aka the “giants”) render them vulnerable to successful adversary attacks. In contrast, small and simple software components with rather limited function and high-assurance layered security properties (aka the “wimps”) can be resistant to adversary attacks. Maintaining root of trust assures a user that a commodity computer’s wimps are isolated from, and safely co-exist with, adversary-controlled giants. To survive, secure wimps must use services of, or compose with, insecure giants. This appears to be “paradoxical:” wimps can counter all adversary attacks but survive only if they use giants’ adversary-controlled services from which they have to defend themselves. \\\nI this seminar, I will illustrate the challenges of root-of-trust establishment via “verifiable boot” operations that do not require secrets, TPMs, or adversary bounds. Then, I will present a method to define a wimp’s adversary accurately and completely using a structure found in cryptographic protocols. A consequence of such definitions is the ability to produce partial orders on adversary attacks. Finally, I will present secure wimp composition with giants, via two examples of experimental systems (i.e., on-demand isolated I/O channels and a trusted display service) designed and implemented at CMU CyLab.\nBiographical Note Virgil D.
