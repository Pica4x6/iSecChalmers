abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of how two devices that are sensing the same heart signal can generate the same cryptographic token by extracting them from the Inter-Pulse Intervals (IPIs) of each cardiac signal. Our analysis is based on the use of a run-time monitor, which is extracted from a formal model and verified against predefined properties, combined with a fuzzy extractor to improve the final result. We first show that it is impossible, in general, to correct the differences between the IPIs derived from two captured electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when using only error correction techniques, thus being impossible to corroborate previous claims on the feasibility of this approach. Then, we provide a large-scale evaluation of the proposed method (run-time monitor and fuzzy extractor) over 19 public databases from the Physionet repository containing heart signals. The results clearly show the practicality of our proposal achieving a 91% of synchronization probability for healthy individuals. Additionally, we also conduct an experiment to check how long the sensors should record the heart signal in order to generate tokens of 32, 64 and 128 bits. Contrarily to what it is usually assumed (6, 12, and 24 s for individuals with a heart rate of 80 beats-per-minute), the sensors have to wait 13, 28 and 56.5 s on median, respectively, to derive the same token from both sensors.},

abstract = {The proliferation of wearable and implantable medical devices has given rise to an interest in developing security schemes suitable for these systems and the environment in which they operate. One area that has received much attention lately is the use of (human) biological signals as the basis for biometric authentication, identification and the generation of cryptographic keys. The heart signal (e.g., as recorded in an electrocardiogram) has been used by several researchers in the last few years. Specifically, the so-called Inter-Pulse Intervals (IPIs), which is the time between two consecutive heartbeats, have been repeatedly pointed out as a potentially good source of entropy and are at the core of various recent authentication protocols. In this work, we report the results of a large-scale statistical study to determine whether such an assumption is (or not) upheld. For this, we have analyzed 19 public datasets of heart signals from the Physionet repository, spanning electrocardiograms from 1353 subjects sampled at different frequencies and with lengths that vary between a few minutes and several hours. We believe this is the largest dataset on this topic analyzed in the literature. We have then applied a standard battery of randomness tests to the extracted IPIs. Under the algorithms described in this paper and after analyzing these 19 public ECG datasets, our results raise doubts about the use of IPI values as a good source of randomness for cryptographic purposes. This has repercussions both in the security of some of the protocols proposed up to now and also in the design of future IPI-based schemes.},

abstract = {The rise of the Internet of Things brings about various challenges concerning safety, reliability and dependability as well as security and privacy. Reliability and safety issues could be addressed by using different verification techniques, both statically and at runtime. In particular, migrating monitors could effectively be used not only for verification purposes, but also as a way to gather information and to enforce certain policies. The addition of monitors, however, might introduce additional security and privacy threats. In this extended abstract we briefly sketch ideas on how to combine migrating monitors with a public cryptographic scheme named Attribute-Based Encryption as a way to ensure monitors are run by the right devices in a secure and private manner.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of privacy-preserving processing of outsourced data in the context of user-customised services. Clients store their data on a server. In order to provide user-dependent services, service providers may ask the server to compute functions on the users' data. We propose a new solution to this problem that guarantees data privacy (i.e., an honest-but-curious server cannot access plaintexts), as well as that service providers can correctly decrypt only –functions on– the data the user gave them access to (i.e., service providers learn nothing more than the result of user-selected computations). Our solution has as base point a new secure labelled homomorphic encryption scheme (LEEG ). LEEG supports additional algorithms (FEET) that enhance the scheme's functionalities with extra privacy-oriented features. Equipped with LEEG and FEET, we define HIKE: A lightweight protocol for private and secure storage, computation and disclosure of users' data. Finally, we implement HIKE and benchmark its performances demonstrating its succinctness and efficiency.},

Billions of pictures are uploaded daily to social networks and, with them, parts of our private life are disclosed. In this work, we propose a practical solution for secure photo sharing on social network with independence of its architecture which can be either centralised or distributed. This solution solves the inconsistencies that appear in distributed social network as a consequence of treating photos and access policies separately. Specifically, we solve this open problem by attaching an access policy to the images and thus, each time a photo is re-shared, the access policy will travel together with the image.},

abstract = { Cryptanalysis is the development and study of attacks against cryptographic primitives and protocols. Many cryptographic properties rely on the difficulty of generating an adversary who, given an object sampled from one of two classes, correctly distinguishes the class used to generate that object. In the case of cipher suite distinguishing problem, the classes are two different cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on machine learning to automatically generate classifiers that can be used by an adversary to solve any distinguishing problem. We discuss the assumptions, a basic approach for improving the advantage of the adversary as well as a phenomenon that we call the “blind spot paradox” . We apply our methodology to generate distinguishers for the NIST (DRBG) cipher suite problem. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the distinguishers might statistically have some advantage to distinguish between the DRBG used. },

abstract = {In recent years many authors have explored the use of biological signals for security issues. In the context of cardiac signals, the use of Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI) values as a source of entropy is one of the most widely used solutions in the literature. To date, there is a broad consensus that the four least significant bits of each IPI are highly entropic and can be used, for instance, in the generation of a cryptographic key. In this article, we demonstrate that the choice of the IPI bits used to date may not be the most correct (e.g., the combination of bits 2638 are much better that the common assumed 5678). To come to our conclusions, we have done a rigorous and in-depth study, analyzing cardiac signals from more than 160,000 files from 19 databases of the Physionet public repository and basing our analysis on the NIST 800-90B recommendation.},

abstract = {Browser extensions are small applications executed in the browser context that provide additional capabilities and enrich the user experience while surfing the web. The acceptance of extensions in current browsers is unquestionable. For instance, Chrome's official extension repository has more than 63,000 extensions, with some of them having more than 10M users. When installed, extensions are pushed into an internal queue within the browser. The order in which each extension executes depends on a number of factors, including their relative installation times. In this paper, we demonstrate how this order can be exploited by an unprivileged malicious extension (i.e., one with no more permissions than those already assigned when accessing web content) to get access to any private information that other extensions have previously introduced. We propose a solution that does not require modifying the core browser engine, since it is implemented as another browser extension. We prove that our approach effectively protects the user against usual attackers (i.e., any other installed extension) as well as against strong attackers having access to the effects of all installed extensions (i.e., knowing who did what). We also prove soundness and robustness of our approach under reasonable assumptions.},

abstract = {Google disabled years ago the possibility to freely modify some internal configuration parameters, so options like silently (un)install browser extensions, changing the home page or the search engine were banned. This capability was as simple as adding/removing some lines from a plain text file called Secure Preferences file automatically created by Chromium the first time it was launched. Concretely, Google introduced a security mechanism based on a cryptographic algorithm named Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to avoid users and applications other than the browser modifying the Secure Preferences file. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to perform browser hijacking, browser extension fingerprinting, and remote code execution attacks as well as silent browser extensions (un)installation by coding a platform-independent proof-of-concept changeware that exploits the HMAC, allowing for free modification of the Secure Preferences file. Last but not least, we analyze the security of the four most important Chromium-based browsers: Brave, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, concluding that all of them suffer from the same security pitfall.},

abstract = {Browser extensions enable rich experience for the users of today's web. Being deployed with elevated privileges, extensions are given the power to overrule web pages. As a result, web pages often seek to detect the installed extensions, sometimes for benign adoption of their behavior but sometimes as part of privacy-violating user fingerprinting. Researchers have studied a class of attacks that allow detecting extensions by probing for Web Accessible Resources (WARs) via URLs that include public extension IDs. Realizing privacy risks associated with WARs, Firefox has recently moved to randomize a browser extension's ID, prompting the Chrome team to plan for following the same path. However, rather than mitigating the issue, the randomized IDs can in fact exacerbate the extension detection problem, enabling attackers to use a randomized ID as a reliable fingerprint of a user. We study a class of extension revelation attacks, where extensions reveal themselves by injecting their code on web pages. We demonstrate how a combination of revelation and probing can uniquely identify 90% out of all extensions injecting content, in spite of a randomization scheme. We perform a series of large-scale studies to estimate possible implications of both classes of attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose a browser-based mechanism that enables control over which extensions are loaded on which web pages and present a proof of concept implementation which blocks both classes of attacks.},
