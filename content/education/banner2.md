Security is becoming increasingly important for system design and development. 
System architects and designers must have security expertise, so that the systems 
they design do not fall victims to attacks. Software developers and engineers 
must have security expertise, so that the code they produce cannot be exploited. 
Security and network specialists must have critical knowledge of security 
principles and practice, in order to ensure the security of the systems they 
are responsible for.
