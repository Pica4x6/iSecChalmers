[Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org). 
We are actively involved in both the 
[Stockholm](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-stockholm/) and 
[Gothenburg](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-gothenburg/) OWASP chapters.

**Security Arena** Our major connection with industrial stake holders in Sweden is the 
[Security Arena](https://securityarena.lindholmen.se/en) at the 
[Lindholmen Science Park](https://www.lindholmen.se).

**URBSEC** (Urban Safety and Societal Security Research Center) offers a research 
interface between practice and academia where needs and problems as experienced 
by various social actors can be addressed.
