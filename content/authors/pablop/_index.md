I am a PostDoc working at Chalmers University, Sweden. I got my PhD in 2016 from Carlos III
University of Madrid. I obtained my BsC in Computer Science in 2010 at UPM University in Madrid
and a year later I completed my  MsC in Computer Science in 2011 at Carlos III University of Madrid.

My research interests range from systems security to applied cryptography. Over the last years I
have worked on a number of areas in these fields, including <i>Browser Extensions</i>, <i>Biometrics</i> or
<i>Security in RFID</i>.

Most of my papers and ongoing work are available online; however, if you should require any copy which
is not online please e-mail me and I will do my best.
