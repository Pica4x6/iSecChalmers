title: Language-based Security
summary: "The course covers the principles of programming language-based techniques 
for computer security. The goal is understanding such application-level attacks as 
races, buffer overruns, covert channels, and code injection as well as mastering 
the principles behind such language-based protection techniques as static analysis, 
program transformation, and reference monitoring. The dual perspective of attack vs. 
protection is threaded through the lectures, laboratory assignments, and projects.
