title: Network Security
summary: "Why is it possible to break into networked applications and computer 
systems? What weaknesses are used? And what makes one protocol more secure than 
another? This course answers these questions and many more. We look at weaknesses 
that have plagued wired and wireless networked systems for years and investigate 
the security of countermeasures like firewalls and security protocols such as SSL, 
SSH and IPsec. Knowledge about possible threats and countermeasures is important 
for understanding what level of security a system and an application can offer.
