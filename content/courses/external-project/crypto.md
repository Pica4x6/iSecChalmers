title: Cryptography
summary: "The course covers cryptographic primitives such as private-key and public-key ciphers, hash functions, MAC's and signatures and how to embed these in cryptographic protocols to achieve basic goals such as confidentiality, authentication and non-repudiation, but also more elaborate services, such as key management, digital cash and electronic voting. Many examples of broken protocols are also discussed to enhance understanding of the engineering difficulties in building secure systems.
