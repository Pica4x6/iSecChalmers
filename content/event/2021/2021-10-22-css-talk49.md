  "Billions of passwords are leaked due to data breaches in the last
  few years and are available online. As users frequently reuse
  passwords, attacks using these leaked passwords are the most
  imminent threat to account security nowadays.  In this talk, I will
  talk about how bad these attacks can be and what we can do to
  protect users.  I will show that it is possible to guess 50% of
  users' passwords in less than a thousand guesses given one of their
  other passwords. I will then talk about two new password breach
  alerting services (PBAS) built to privately check if user passwords
  are vulnerable to such attacks and take action to protect the user
  accounts. These services however bring forth new threats, and if not
  designed properly could hurt user’s account security instead of
  helping. We will go over some deployment conundrums of PBAS and how
  to navigate them."
