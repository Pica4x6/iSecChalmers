teaser: In this talk, I will present some work in progress on using IFC principles
  for enforcing GDPR-style privacy principles. Privacy legislation such as the GDPR
  specifies legal requirements for protecting the private data of individuals but
  remains vague about how to implement such requirements in practice. Traditional
  security mechanisms such as cryptography or access control are blunt instruments
  for this job since they typically cannot distinguish between intended and inappropriate
  usage of private data. To complement them, I propose a programming language-based
  framework that uses IFC mechanisms to enforce privacy principles such as purpose
  limitation and data minimization. I will start by illustrating how these principles
  are ultimately about information flow and how they can be integrated in existing
  IFC frameworks. Iâ€™ll then sketch a simple type system for tracking secure and private
  information flow.
