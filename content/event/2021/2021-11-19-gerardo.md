summary: "Finding suitable ways to handle personal data in conformance with the law
is challenging. For existing systems the challenge is
to be able to show evidence that they are already complying with the GDPR, or
otherwise to work towards compliance by modifying their systems and procedures,
or alternatively reprogramming their systems in order to pass the eventual controls. 
In this short non-technical talk I will give my personal opinion on
issues related to the ambition of achieving Privacy by Construction."

abstract: "Finding suitable ways to handle personal data in conformance with the law 
is challenging. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enforced 
since May 2018, makes it mandatory to citizens and companies to comply with the 
privacy requirements set in the regulation. For existing systems the challenge is 
to be able to show evidence that they are already complying with the GDPR, or 
otherwise to work towards compliance by modifying their systems and procedures, 
or alternatively reprogramming their systems in order to pass the eventual controls. 
For those starting new projects the advice is to take privacy into consideration 
since the very beginning, already at design time. This has been known as Privacy 
by Design (PbD). The main question is how much privacy can you effectively achieve 
by using PbD, and in particular whether it is possible to achieve Privacy by 
Construction. In this short non-technical talk I will give my personal opinion on 
issues related to the ambition of achieving Privacy by Construction.
