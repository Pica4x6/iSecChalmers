teaser: This presentation provides an introduction to fuzz testing of automotive systems
  with a focus on both process and practical topics. We first discuss the typical
  automotive development process to better understand where the fuzz testing activity
  fits into the overall process. We also discuss common practical pitfalls and challenges
  when performing fuzz testing of automotive systems. Based on this understanding,
  a few examples of how fuzz testing can be performed in practice, including how to
  build a fuzz testing environment for automotive systems, are explained. Last, we
  also explore how to perform continuous fuzz testing using automated tools and virtual
  ECUs as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
