abstract: "
Web application security is a complicated matter. To assist site operators in secure web application development, browser vendors offer client-side security mechanisms designed to offer robust protection against common threats. Unfortunately, prior research showed that these mechanisms are often ineffective in practice for several reasons. In this talk, I provide yet another perspective on why client-side security mechanisms often fail, by focusing on the problem of inconsistent configuration. Inconsistencies not only affect web application security, but might also bias the results of web security measurements. In particular, I identify inconsistencies in the adoption of popular client-side security mechanisms like CSP, HSTS and cookie security attributes, which motivates the relevance of this issue and the need for further research on it.
