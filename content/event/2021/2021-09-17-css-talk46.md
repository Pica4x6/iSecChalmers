summary : "The GDPR promotes the principle of Privacy by Design and Default,
acknowledging that the individual’s privacy is best protected if
privacy law is complemented by privacy enhancing technologies
(PETs). While technically advanced PETs have been researched and
developed in the last four decades, challenges remain for making
PETs and their configurations usable.  In particular, PETs are often
based on “crypto-magic” operations that are counterintuitive and for
which no real-world analogies can be easily found."

  The GDPR promotes the principle of Privacy by Design and Default,
  acknowledging that the individual’s privacy is best protected if
  privacy law is complemented by privacy enhancing technologies
  (PETs). While technically advanced PETs have been researched and
  developed in the last four decades, challenges remain for making
  PETs and their configurations usable.  In particular, PETs are often
  based on “crypto-magic” operations that are counterintuitive and for
  which no real-world analogies can be easily found.


  This presentation presents human computer interaction challenges,
  end user perceptions and requirements for the design and
  configurations of PETs in compliance with the GDPR that we explored
  in recent European research projects. The presentation discusses
  cultural privacy aspects impacting the users’ preferences and trust
  in PETs, and it shows that users with technical knowledge may
  especially encounter challenges in understanding and trusting the
  protection claims of PETs. It concludes that for this reason, PET
  user interfaces should not only have to build on real-world
  analogies but also need to cater for digital world analogies that
  may impact the users’ understanding of PETs.
