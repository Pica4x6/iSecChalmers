**Abstract:**\\
IT security is an ever important topic. From pioneering to modern times, new security problems keep being discovered. Still, many problems stem from similar flaws. As such, solutions to security problems often involve applying old solutions to new settings. In this talk, we elaborate on the nature of security problems, where they arise, and what methodology is needed to tackle such problems.

In addition, we also discuss common misconceptions about IT security, and, building upon years of experience, learn how to think like a hacker.
