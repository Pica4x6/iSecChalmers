abstract: "IT security is an ever important topic. From pioneering to modern times, new security 
problems keep being discovered. Still, many problems stem from similar flaws. 
As such, solutions to security problems often involve applying old solutions to 
new settings. In this talk, we elaborate on the nature of security problems, where 
they arise, and what methodology is needed to tackle such problems."
