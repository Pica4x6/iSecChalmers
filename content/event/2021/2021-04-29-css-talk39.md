  Information flow properties are the semantic cornerstone of a wide
  range of program transformations, program analyses, and security
  properties. The variety of information that can be transmitted from
  inputs to outputs in a deterministic system can be elegantly and very
  generally captured by representing information as equivalence
  relations over the sets of possible values, using an equivalence
  relation on the input domain to model what may be learned, and an
  equivalence relation on the output to model what may be observed. The
  set of equivalence relations over a given set of values form a
  lattice, where the partial order models containment of information,
  and lattice join models the effect of combining information. This
  elegant and general structure is sometimes referred to as the lattice
  of information (Landauer & Redmond CSFW'93).

  In this work we identify an abstraction of information flow which has
  not been studied previously, namely disjunctive dependency. We argue
  that this is both interesting in its own right, providing for example
  an information flow based semantic model of Chinese-wall policies, and
  potentially provides increased precision in the application of
  dependency analysis to computation of quantitative properties. We
  achieve this via a generalization of the lattice of information to a
  quantale, a lattice equipped with a tensor operation where the lattice
  join corresponds to the disjunctive combination of information, and
  tensor corresponds to conjunctive combination.
