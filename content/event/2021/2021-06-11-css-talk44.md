  High-assurance cryptography leverages methods from program
  verification and cryptography engineering to deliver efficient
  cryptographic software with machine-checked proofs of memory safety,
  functional correctness, provable security, and absence of timing
  leaks. Traditionally, these guarantees are established under a
  sequential execution semantics. However, this semantics is not
  aligned with the behavior of modern processors that make use of
  speculative execution to improve performance. This mismatch,
  combined with the high-profile Spectre-style attacks that exploit
  speculative execution, naturally casts doubts on the robustness of
  high-assurance cryptography guarantees. In this paper, we dispel
  these doubts by showing that the benefits of high-assurance
  cryptography extend to speculative execution, costing only a modest
  performance overhead. We build atop the Jasmin verification
  framework an end-to-end approach for proving properties of
  cryptographic software under speculative execution, and validate our
  approach experimentally with efficient, functionally correct
  assembly implementations of ChaCha20 and Poly1305, which are secure
  against both traditional timing and speculative execution attacks.
