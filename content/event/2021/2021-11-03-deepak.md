summary: "This talk will present the design of CoVault, a work-in-progress
system for securely storing and querying data under a very strong
threat model that doesn’t place trust in any one entity or
authority, and includes the complete compromise of all CPUs of a
specific manufacturer, as well as many common side channel
attacks."
abstract: "The recent Covid-19 pandemic has shown that individuals’ whereabouts
and social contact data can be very effective in understanding a new
infectious disease in a timely manner. However, due to the
privacy-sensitive nature of such data, liberal societies have
hesitated to even collect such data. Part of the problem is the lack
of technology for securely storing and querying such data in the
presence of extremely strong adversaries (e.g., state-sponsored
adversaries).

This talk will present the design of CoVault, a work-in-progress
system for securely storing and querying data under a very strong
threat model that doesn’t place trust in any one entity or
authority, and includes the complete compromise of all CPUs of a
specific manufacturer, as well as many common side channel
attacks. This threat model transcends prior work on database
security. Technically, CoVault relies on state-of-the-art trusted
execution environments, secret sharing and secure multi-party
computation. While this combination is expensive in terms of
computational power, we believe that this design point is worth
exploring for applications like epidemic studies where security is
non-negotiable, but the returns for society are extremely high.
