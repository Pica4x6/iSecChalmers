abstract: "Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) connect disparate online services
  and enable users to create automation rules in diverse domains such
  as smart homes and business productivity. Unfortunately, the current
  TAP design is flawed from a privacy perspective, since it has
  unfettered access to sensitive user data. We point out that TAPs
  suffer from two types of overprivilege: (1) attribute-level, where
  it has access to more data attributes than it needs for running
  user-created rules; and (2) token-level, where it has access to more
  APIs than it needs. To mitigate overprivilege and subsequent privacy
  concerns we design and implement minTAP, a practical approach to
  data access minimization in TAPs. Our key insight is that the
  semantics of a user-created automation rule implicitly specifies the
  minimal amount of data it needs. This allows minTAP to leverage
  language-based data minimization to apply the principle of
  least-privilege by releasing only the necessary attributes of user
  data to the TAP. Using real user-created rules on the popular IFTTT
  TAP, we demonstrate that minTAP on average sanitizes 3.7 sensitive
  data attributes per rule, with tolerable performance overhead and
  without modifying IFTTT.
