summary: "Having spent almost 30 years in the
field, Ivan intends to provide his insights — opinions
informed by experience — about the information security
discipline and its young history: Where we are, how did we get here,
and what we could look for in the future of our field."

abstract: "In the 1990s the information security (infosec) community was not
  what it is today is such an obvious statement that it shouldn't be
  used to start any abstract.

  However, if we further qualify and describe more precisely all the
  different aspects in which the 1990s and today's infosec communities
  differ, the way academia, industry and practitioners evolved over
  time, the co-evolution of security attacks & defenses, and the
  fundamental problems that remain unsolved, we may start to have the
  outline of an interesting talk.  Having spent almost 30 years in the
  field, Ivan intends to provide his insights — opinions
  informed by experience — about the information security
  discipline and its young history: Where we are, how did we get here,
  and what we could look for in the future of our field.  If you are
  interested in a career in infosec this may be a good opportunity to
  hear the perspective of a veteran in the field.  This will not be a
  technical talk and it will not be narrowly focused on a specific
  topic but the speaker will not shy away from technical discussion."
