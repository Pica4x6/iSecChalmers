**Abstract:**\\
We consider the problem of outsourcing computation on data authenticated by different users. 
Our aim is to describe and implement the simplest possible solution to provide data integrity in cloud-based scenarios. 
Concretely, our multi-key linearly homomorphic signature scheme (mklhs) allows users to upload signed data on a server, 
and at any later point in time any third party can query the server to compute a linear combination of data authenticated 
by different users and check the correctness of the returned result. Our construction generalizes Boneh et al.’s linearly 
homomorphic signature scheme (PKC’09 [7]) to the multi-key setting and relies on basic tools of pairing-based cryptography. 
Compared to existing multi-key homomorphic signature schemes, our mklhs is a conceptually simple and elegant direct construction,
which trades-off privacy for efficiency. The simplicity of our approach leads us to a very efficient construction that enjoys 
significantly shorter signatures and higher performance than previous proposals. Finally, we implement mklhs using two 
different pairing-friendly curves at the 128-bit security level, a Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve and a Barreto-Naehrig curve. 
Our benchmarks illustrate interesting performance trade-offs between these parameters, involving the cost of exponentiation and 
hashing inpairing groups. 
We provide a discussion on such trade-offs that can be useful to other implementers of pairing-based protocols.
