**Abstract:**\\

We propose a new formal criterion for evaluating secure
compartmentalization schemes for unsafe languages like C and C++,
expressing end-to-end security guarantees for software components that
may become compromised after encountering undefined behavior---for
example, by accessing an array out of bounds. Our criterion is the
first to model dynamic compromise in a system of mutually distrustful
components with clearly specified privileges. It articulates how each
component should be protected from all the others---in particular,
from components that have encountered undefined behavior and become
compromised.
To illustrate the model, we construct a secure compilation chain for a
small unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components,
targeting a simple abstract machine with built-in
compartmentalization. We propose a novel proof technique and give a
machine-checked proof in Coq that this compiler satisfies our secure
compilation criterion. Finally, we show that the protection guarantees
offered by the compartmentalized abstract machine can be achieved at
the machine-code level using either software fault isolation or a
tag-based reference monitor.

**Speaker Bio:**\\

[Catalin Hritcu](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu) is a
researcher at Inria Paris where he works on security foundations. He is
particularly interested in formal methods for security (secure compilation,
compartmentalization, memory safety, security protocols, integrity, information
flow), programming languages (program verification, proof assistants, type
systems, semantics, formal metatheory, certified tools, property-based testing),
and the design and verification of security-critical systems (reference
monitors, secure compilation chains, secure hardware). He was awarded an ERC
Starting Grant on formally secure compilation
[(https://secure-compilation.github.io)](https://secure-compilation.github.io),
and is also actively involved in the design of the F* verification system
[(https://www.fstar-lang.org/)](https://www.fstar-lang.org/), which is used for
building a formally verified HTTPS stack
[(https://project-everest.github.io)](https://project-everest.github.io). Catalin
received a PhD from Saarland University in Saarbrücken, a Habilitation from ENS
Paris, and was previously also a Research Associate at University of
Pennsylvania and a Visiting Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond.
