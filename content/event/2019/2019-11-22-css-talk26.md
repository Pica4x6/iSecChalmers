**Abstract:**\\

In this talk, I present an approach to enhance informed consent
for the processing of personal data. The approach relies on a
privacy policy language used to express, compare and analyze
privacy policies. I describe a tool that automatically reports
the privacy risks associated with a given privacy policy in order
to enhance data subjects' awareness and to allow them to make
more informed choices. The risk analysis of privacy policies is
illustrated with an IoT example.

This talk is based on work published at
DBSec19, and a paper under submission to the Journal of Computer
Security. You can find an publicly available version of the paper here
