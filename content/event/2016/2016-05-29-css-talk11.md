**Abstract:**\\
This talk will be about privacy engineering, a field mainly concerned
with techniques, methods, and tools to systematically take into account
and address privacy issues when building a system. During this journey,
we will explore the difference between security and privacy and see why
the study of privacy in a system requires an interdisciplinary approach.
Finally, we will have a look at the current research challenges needed
to be tackled to be in a situation to deliver more privacy in
information systems.
