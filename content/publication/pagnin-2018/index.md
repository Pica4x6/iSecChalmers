abstract: "We consider the problem of privacy-preserving processing of outsourced\
  \ data in the context of user-customised services. Clients store their data on a\
  \ server. In order to provide user-dependent services, service providers may ask\
  \ the server to compute functions on the users' data. We propose a new solution\
  \ to this problem that guarantees data privacy (i.e., an honest-but-curious server\
  \ cannot access plaintexts), as well as that service providers can correctly decrypt\
  \ only –functions on– the data the user gave them access to (i.e., service providers\
  \ learn nothing more than the result of user-selected computations). Our solution\
  \ has as base point a new secure labelled homomorphic encryption scheme (LEEG ).\
  \ LEEG supports additional algorithms (FEET) that enhance the scheme's functionalities\
  \ with extra privacy-oriented features. Equipped with LEEG and FEET, we define HIKE:\
  \ A lightweight protocol for private and secure storage, computation and disclosure\
  \ of users' data. Finally, we implement HIKE and benchmark its performances demonstrating\
  \ its succinctness and efficiency."
