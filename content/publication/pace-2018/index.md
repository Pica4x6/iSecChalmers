abstract: The rise of the Internet of Things brings about various challenges concerning
  safety, reliability and dependability as well as security and privacy. Reliability
  and safety issues could be addressed by using different verification techniques,
  both statically and at runtime. In particular, migrating monitors could effectively
  be used not only for verification purposes, but also as a way to gather information
  and to enforce certain policies. The addition of monitors, however, might introduce
  additional security and privacy threats. In this extended abstract we briefly sketch
  ideas on how to combine migrating monitors with a public cryptographic scheme named
  Attribute-Based Encryption as a way to ensure monitors are run by the right devices
  in a secure and private manner.
