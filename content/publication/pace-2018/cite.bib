 abstract = {The rise of the Internet of Things brings about various challenges concerning safety, reliability and dependability as well as security and privacy. Reliability and safety issues could be addressed by using different verification techniques, both statically and at runtime. In particular, migrating monitors could effectively be used not only for verification purposes, but also as a way to gather information and to enforce certain policies. The addition of monitors, however, might introduce additional security and privacy threats. In this extended abstract we briefly sketch ideas on how to combine migrating monitors with a public cryptographic scheme named Attribute-Based Encryption as a way to ensure monitors are run by the right devices in a secure and private manner.},
