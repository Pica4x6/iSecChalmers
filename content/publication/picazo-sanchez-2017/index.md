abstract: Nowadays, in an ubiquitous world where everything is connected to the Internet
  and where social networks play an important role in our lives, security and privacy
  is a must. Billions of pictures are uploaded daily to social networks and, with
  them, parts of our private life are disclosed. In this work, we propose a practical
  solution for secure photo sharing on social network with independence of its architecture
  which can be either centralised or distributed. This solution solves the inconsistencies
  that appear in distributed social network as a consequence of treating photos and
  access policies separately. Specifically, we solve this open problem by attaching
  an access policy to the images and thus, each time a photo is re-shared, the access
  policy will travel together with the image.
