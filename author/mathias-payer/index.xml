His research focuses on protecting applications in the presence of vulnerabilities, with a focus on memory corruption and type violations. He is interested in software security, system security, binary exploitation, effective mitigations, fault isolation/privilege separation, strong sanitization, and software testing (fuzzing) using a combination of binary analysis and
compiler-based techniques. Research in the HexHive group is generously supported by the ERC, SNSF, DARPA, ONR, AFOSR, or NSF, as well as several industry partners. Follow him on Twitter @gannimo.
